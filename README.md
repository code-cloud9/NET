# Nonparametric Inference on Network Effects

## Introduction

The code is for reproducing the numerical experiments and data example results in 'Optimal Nonparametric Inference on Network Effects with Dependent Edges'.

## Guidelines for Result Replication

### Results in Simulation
  
1) **Figure 1 and Table 3:** Please go to folder `./simulation_main/empirical_typeIerror/` and run `typeIerror_and_qqplot.R` in R to obtain the results. The implementation code for experiments is located in `./configurations/`. To save time, one can use the intermediate results saved in the folder `./outputs/` to calculate the empirical sizes.

2) **Table 4:** Please go to folder `./simulation_main/empirical_power/` and run `power.R` in R to obtain the results. The implementation code for experiments is located in `./configurations/`. To save time, one can use the intermediate results saved in the folder `./outputs/` to calculate the empirical powers.

### Results in Application

1) **Table 6:** Please go to folder `./application_faculty_hiring_networks/` and run `*.R` to obtain the results, where `*` is `Business`, `CS`, and `History`. The data matrices are in folder `./ready_to_use_data_matrices/`, and the original data files are given in paper <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400005">Systematic inequality and hierarchy in faculty hiring networks</a>.

### Results in Appendix E

1) **Table S1 and Figure S1:** Please run `./simulation_main/empirical_typeIerror/typeIerror_and_qqplot.R` to obtain the results.

2) **Figure S2:** Please go to folder `./simulation_appendix/` and run `lambda_plot.R` in R to obtain the results. The implementation code for experiments is located in `./configurations/`. To save time, one can use the intermediate results saved in the folder `./outputs/` to calculate the empirical sizes.

### Results in Appendix F

1) **Figure S4 and Table S2:** First download the data in paper <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/melitz/publications/estimating-trade-flows-trading-partners-and-trading-volumes">Estimating trade flows: Trading partners and trading volumes</a>. Then please run `./application_international_trade_network/trade_network.R` to obtain the results.
